			<h2>Seed Instructions:</h2>
			<table>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td><strong><em>Step 1</em></strong><br>
						• Start with the bomb's serial number.<br>
						• If the bomb has 2 or more PS/2 ports, multiply every numeric value on the serial number by 2. Otherwise, add 5 to every numeric value on the serial number<br>
						• If a number goes past 9, subtract 10.<br>
						<strong><em>Step 2</em></strong><br>
						• For each indicator on the bomb that has a matching letter on the serial number (x), if the indicator is lit, add x to the letter of the serial number. If the indicator is unlit, subtract x to the letter of the serial number. (See the table below for help)<br>
						• Otherwise, for each port name that has a matching letter on the serial number (y), multiply y to the letter. (See the table below for help)<br>
						• Otherwise, if there's one or more empty port plates, add 1 to every letter on the serial number. (See the table below for help)<br>
						• Otherwise, subtract 1 to every letter on the serial number. (See the table below for help)<br>
						<strong><em>Step 3</em></strong><br>
						• Convert every letter to a number. This is now your base seed. To get your final seed, follow the rules below.<br>
						• If a value on the seed matches a value (numeric or lettered) on the original serial number, add the digits of the seed, and that number is n. Otherwise, n is now the first digit of the seed. (see "defining n" for help.)<br>
						• If a value on the seed is equal to the number of indicators, n is the number of indicators. If there are more lit than unlit indicators, multiply n by 2. Otherwise, if there are more unlit than lit indicators, subtract n by 2. Otherwise, if there are equal lit and unlit indicators, leave n as is. If there are no indicators, n is 5. If n is greater than 9, or less than 0, add or subtract 10 until n is 0-9.<br>
						• If a value on the seed is equal to the number of ports, n is the number of port plates. If there's an empty port plate, n is multiplied by 4, and use the least significant digit. Otherwise, if there are no port plates, n is the last digit of the seed.<br>
						• n is equal to the number of modules on the bomb, excluding needy modules.<br>
						• n is equal to the last digit of the seed squared. If n is one digit, add a 0 to the beginning. Instead of one digit this time, n will be 2 digits.</td>

			<h3>Now, your seed should be a 12 digit number. See the "result instructions".</h3>

		<h2>Alphabet Math</h2>
		<p>
						Every letter in the alphabet has an assigned number.<br>
						The letter A is equal to 1, and the letter Z is equal to 26.<br>
						If your calculated number is lower than 1, or greater than 26, add or subtract 26 until you get a number 1-26.<br>
						Use the least significant digit for doing the steps above.
						I have provided the letters and numbers for you:<br>

		<h2>Defining "n"</h2>
		<p>
			"n" is the last position of the seed plus 1. If my seed was 756432, n would be 7, because there are 6 positions, and n is the 7th. <br>
			When n is assgined a new number, it's not the position, it's the label for that position.<br>
			For example: My seed is 231345, and n is 6, my new seed is 2313456. Value n is 7, so my new seed is 23134567, and so on.
		</p>
		<h2>Result instructions</h2>
		<p>
			Congratulations, you have your seed!<br>
			s will be the position number for the seed.<br>
			For the first digit, s is 1, and for the last digit, s is 12.<br>
			Multiply the sth position by s, and use the least significant digit.<br>
			To find what buttons to press, convert the numbers to letters using the chart in "Alphabet Math"<br>
			Starting with one letter at a time, use the chart below to determine what new button to press.<br>
			<strong>Just like the original Simon Says, you have to input the button along with the buttons from the previous stages.</strong><br>
